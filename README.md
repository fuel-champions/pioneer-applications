Welcome to your starting point in the Fuel Developer Champions Program! ðŸ™Œ

This program seeks to empower Fuel developers and unlock your potential, to provide resources for you to level up your skills and to participate in the future development of Fuel. As a member of this program you will have access to dedicated opportunities to network, to learn, and to be mentored by leading devs in the Fuel community. You will also have the chance to showcase your work and to help others in the community. Let's not forget also access to exclusive merch based on your level and contributions!

To begin your journey as a Fuel Developer Champion, simply [create a new application](https://github.com/fuel-champions/pioneer-applications/issues/new/choose) in this repository.

The requirements to become a Pioneer are:

* Experience in web3
* Interest in building on Fuel
* Proof of code contributions to open source web3 projects, not necessarily Fuel, but it's a plus
* Agreement to abide by the [Fuel Developer Champions Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fuel-champions/code-of-conduct)

Once you have submitted your application, the Fuel team will review it and respond with next steps.
