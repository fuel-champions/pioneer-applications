            Thank you for your application to become a Champion! We will review your application and get back to you as soon as possible. ‚ú®

            A quick note about our process:

            We check applications on a rolling basis, so it may take a few days for us to get back to you.
            We are committed to checking every application within 7 days of submission. üëç

            You are welcome to review the tiers of the program and more details in the [start-here repository](https://github.com/fuel-champions/start-here).

            Have any questions? You're welcome to drop a comment in this issue and we'll do our best to clarify! üôå
